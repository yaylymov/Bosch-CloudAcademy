# Terraform Expressions

## Overview

This folder has two small practical examples using expressions in Terraform:

1. [foreach](./01_foreach): This example shows how to use the `foreach` expression to create multiple resources with the same configuration.
2. [json](./02_json): This example shows how to use the `jsonencode` function to create a JSON string from a map and use this as a baseline for a configuration.

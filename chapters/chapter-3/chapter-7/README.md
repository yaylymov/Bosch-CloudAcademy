# Chapter 7 - Reverse Engineering

Welcome to Chapter 7! This chapter is a bit different from the previous ones. Your mission: implement changes in the architecture diagram on the portal. Let's get hacking!

1. **Analyze the Architecture**: Take a close look at the architecture diagram provided below
   
   ![Architecture Diagram](00_app-service-reference-architecture-complete.png)
   
   You can also download the full architecture diagram here: [Download Full Architecture Diagram](./app-service-reference-architecture-complete.vsdx)

2. **Implement Changes**: Identify the areas that need improvement or modification and implement those changes directly in the Azure Portal.

Challenge yourself to complete these tasks on your own! If you encounter difficulties, continue with the following tasks and hints.

## Tasks and Hints

## Task 1 - Secure your Azure Cosmos DB in ``database`` subnet

1. Secure your Azure Cosmos DB in ``database`` subnet

<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint 1: Find the Networking settings of the Cosmos DB</summary>
<br>

Go to your "Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB account (RU)" resource on Azure Portal.

Under the "Settings" Section you will find the "Networking" section.

Open the Networking section and click the tab "Public access".

</details>

<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint 2: Secure your Azure Cosmos DB with a VNET (Virtual Network)</summary>
<br>

Under "Public access" settings, select "Selected networks".

Click on "+ Add existing virtual network"

Select the VNET and ``database`` as subnet.

Click "add" and SAVE the configuration on "Public access" settings.

<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint 1: Find the Networking settings of the Key Vault</summary>
<br>

Go to your "Key vault" resource on Azure Portal.

Under the "Settings" Section you will find the "Networking" section.

Open the Networking section and click the tab "Firewalls and virtual networks".

</details>
<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint 2: Secure your Key Vault with a VNET.</summary>
<br>

Select option to allow access from: "Allow public access from specific virtual networks and IP addresses".

Click on "+ Add a virtual network" and choose "+ Add existing virtual networks"

</details>

3. Select the `security` subnet and *apply* the changes.

## Task 3 - Isolate the Log Analytics Workspace

1. Enable network isolation for your Log Analytics Workspace.

ðŸ“˜ How-To Guide: [Enable network isolation for Azure Monitor Agent by using Private Link - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-private-link)

<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint 1: Find the Network Isolation settings of the Log Analytics workspace</summary>

# Chapter 5 - Network Architecture - Secure the resources

## Organizing Resources into Subnets

We created our VNET with 4 different subnets:
* **default** ``10.0.0.0/24``
* **api** ``10.0.1.0/24``
* **database** ``10.0.3.0/24``
* **web_app** ``10.0.2.0/24``

- The tasks of this chapter is to integrate each resource into its corresponding subnet within the Virtual Network.

We will start with the Application API ( ``app-api-`` resource ).

## TASK 1: Web API -> ``api`` Subnet

- Go to the **Networking** settings of the Web API

<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint: How-to 1: Find Networking settings of the API</summary>
<br>

Go to your Web App resource ( Web App resource starting with the prefix ``app-api-`` ) on Azure Portal.

Under the "Settings" Section you will find the "Networking" section.

Open the Networking section and under the tab "Outbound traffic configuration" find "Virtual network integration".

</details>

- Configure Virtual Network Integration

<details close>
<summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint: How-to 2: Find Networking settings of the API</summary>
<br>

Open the Networking section. Under the tab "Outbound traffic configuration" find "Virtual network integration". Click on the text "not configured".

Add Virtual Network Integration. Refer to the following settings

</details>

Connect the API with the following configuration:

**Add virtual network integration**
* **Subscription:** ``[Your Subscription Name]``
* **Virtual Network:** ``\<VNET created in the previeous exercise\>``
* **Subnet:** ``api``

 ## Success criteria

- You have successfully integrated the Web App API into the VNET.

## TASK 2: Test the connection again

Test the connection by browsing TODO items on the website

- Browse the application web site

Go to the application website and click on the website URL

## Success Criteria ðŸŽ‰

- ðŸŽŠ **Congratulations!** You have successfully re-established a connection to the database through a private endpoint.
- âœ… **TODO items are now loading again**, confirming that a private connection between the Web API and the database is ensured.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Checkpoint - DNS Resolution

In this checkpoint, you will review the DNS settings for a specific resource in your Azure environment.

## Steps to Follow:

1. **Navigate to Your Resource Group:**
   - Access the Azure portal.
   - Locate your resource group that contains the DNS resource.

2. **Find the DNS Resource:**
   - Within the resource group, look for the DNS resource named **privatelink.mongo.cosmos.azure.com**.

3. **Review A-records:**
   - Click on the DNS resource to open its details page.
   - Navigate to the **Record sets** section under **DNS Management**.
   - Examine the A-records listed there.

By following these steps, you will gain an understanding of the DNS resolution process for the specified resource.

## TASK 3: Put the Web Site App into a Subnet

In this task, we will continue placing each resource into its respective subnet within the Virtual Network.

Repeat the same steps to integrate the **Web Site App resource** (resource with the prefix ``app-web-``) into the designated subnet.

### Add Virtual Network Integration

Integrate the **Web Site App resource** (resource with the prefix ``app-web-``) to the subnet *web_app* within the VNET.

1. Navigate to the **Web Site App resource** in your Azure portal.
2. Click on the **Networking** section.
3. Under **VNet Integration**, click **not configured**.
4. Configure the network integration with the following details:
   - **Subscription**: ``[Your Subscription Name]``
   - **Virtual Network**: ``[Select your VNET]``
   - **Subnet**: ``web_app``

5. Save the configuration.

## Success Criteria ðŸŽ‰

- ðŸŽŠ **Congratulations!** You have successfully integrated Web Site App and API to its subnets!

## ðŸ’¡ Architecture Checkpoint - Drawing - Update the Architecture Diagram

In this checkpoint, you will update the architecture diagram to include the network resources.

## Instructions

1. **Template**
   - Begin with your [template from previous exercise](../app-service-reference-architecture-webapp.vsdx).

2. **Update the Diagram**
   - Add the following network resources to the diagram:
     - **Virtual Network**
       - Subnet: `web_app`
       - Subnet: `api`
       - Subnet: `database`
       - Subnet: `default`
     - **Private Endpoint**
     - **DNS Zone**

## Additional Notes
- Ensure each subnet is correctly labeled and positioned within the Virtual Network.
- Verify that connections between resources are logically represented.
